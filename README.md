# Horiseon Code Refactor

The purpose of this project is to increase Horiseon's web accessibility. By doing so, the site will gain higher ranking in search engines which generates more traffic for the business. Accessible sites also benefit individuals regardless of disability, hence, adhere to accessibility standards.

All elements from the site have been improved for long-term sustainability without the change of site appearance and functionality.
