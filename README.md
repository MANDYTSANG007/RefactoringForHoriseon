# Horiseon Code Refactor

The purpose of this project is to refactor Horiseon's, a marketing agency, website for increasing its web accessibility. By doing so, the site will gain higher ranking in search engines which generates more traffic for the business. Accessible sites benefit the public regardless of disability, and hence adhere to accessibility standards.

All elements from the site have been improved for long-term sustainability without the change of site appearance and functionality.
